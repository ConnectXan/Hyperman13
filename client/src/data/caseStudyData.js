                # Scaling Vedic Wellness
                In late 2024, Vedic Wellness was at a plateau. Their CAC was rising and ROAS was dipping below 2.5x.
                
                ## The Strategy
                We implemented a three-tier funnel:
                1. **Awareness**: AI-generated educational videos about Ashwagandha benefits.
                2. **Consideration**: User-generated content (UGC) from verified Indian yoga instructors.
                3. **Conversion**: High-intent retargeting with exclusive bundle offers.
                
                ## The Results
                By month 4, we had scaled them to ₹1.2Cr monthly spend with a stable 4.2x ROAS.

                # Speed as a Feature
                For Jaipur Jewels, conversion was directly tied to mobile load times.
                
                ## Optimization Path
                We removed all legacy apps and replaced them with custom-coded liquid solutions.
                Using cloudflare workers, we implemented regional edge caching across India.
                
                ## The Impact
                Checkouts increased by 35% within the first two weeks of the new launch.
